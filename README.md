## WHO MADE THIS?

I did, with a little help from the internet. Thanks, internet.

## WHAT IS THIS?

This is a random password generator. It was made using HTML and JavaScript and was stylized using Bootstrap. This generator will make a password between 8 - 128 characters and will generate the password with any combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols. It also allows the user to copy the generated password straight to their clipboard and paste it immediately.

## WHY DID I MAKE THIS?

This was a homework assignment for a full-stack web developement boot camp. It was created to show understanding of basic JavaScript using loops, conditionals, functions and managing and creating arrays and objects, while also interacting with the DOM for user input.

## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

I may come back to this project at a later time and create a radio toggle that will allow the user to input what symbols they want to be used in the password. Right now the list of symbols used is quite long and has some charcters included that likely will not work with some password inputs on different sites. A highly functional and easy to use program would fully complete this project.
